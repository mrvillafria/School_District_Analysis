# PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be using Python and the Pandas Library in Jupyter Notebook. Pandas is an open-source Python library that is specific for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas contains very powerful data structures, such as Series and Dataframes, and can be used as a tool to analyze and clean data in the Python programming language. In additional to Pandas, we will be using Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is a web-based application where you can write and execute live code to import, sort, and visualize data. This interactive tool is easy to use and is a great way to show and check the results quickly from your code. Using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook, we will be able to help others find trends and make strategic decisions based on our findings.
